1. Communication Media and Network Architecture
----------------------------------------------------------
    Communication Media:
        
        Wired Media: Twisted pair cables, coaxial cables, and fiber optics.
        
        Wireless Media: Radio waves, microwaves, and infrared.
        
        Characteristics: Bandwidth, latency, noise resistance, and signal attenuation.
    
    
    
    Network Architecture:
    
        OSI Model:
        
            Seven layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport,
            Session, Presentation, Application.
        
            Provides standard protocols for interoperability.
        
        TCP/IP Model:
        
            Four layers: Network Access, Internet, Transport, Application.
            
            Focuses on the practical implementation of networking protocols.
    
    



2. Network Security and IPv4
------------------------------------
      Network Security:
      
          Ensures confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data.
      
          Techniques include encryption, firewalls, intrusion 
          detection systems, and secure protocols like SSL/TLS.
      
      
      
      IPv4:
      
          A 32-bit addressing scheme with approximately 4.3 billion unique addresses.
          
          Address format: Dotted decimal notation (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
          
          Supports protocols like ARP, ICMP, and DHCP.






3. Modulation Techniques and Switching Techniques
------------------------------------------------------
        Modulation Techniques:
        
              Analog Modulation: 
                  Amplitude Modulation (AM), 
                  Frequency Modulation (FM), and 
                  Phase Modulation (PM).
                                
              Digital Modulation: 
                  ASK, FSK, PSK, and QAM.



        Switching Techniques:
        
              Circuit Switching: 
                  Establishes a dedicated path before communication.
              
              Packet Switching: 
                  Data is divided into packets, routed independently.
              
              Message Switching: 
                  Entire message is sent to the intermediate node
                  and stored until forwarded.




4. Boolean Algebra and Fundamentals of Processor
------------------------------------------------------
        Boolean Algebra:
        
              Mathematical approach for binary systems.
              
              Operators: AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR.
              
              Applications in logic gate design and digital circuits.




        Fundamentals of Processor:
        
              Central Processing Unit (CPU): Performs arithmetic and logical operations.
              
              Components: Control Unit (CU), Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), Registers.
              
              Instruction cycle: Fetch, Decode, Execute, and Store.
        




5. Memory Organization and I/O Structure
---------------------------------------------
        Memory Organization:
        
              Types: Primary (RAM, ROM), 
              Secondary (Hard Drives, SSDs), 
              Cache, and Virtual Memory.
        
        Hierarchical structure to optimize performance and cost.
        
        Access methods: Random access, sequential access.



      
      I/O Structure:
      
            Input/Output devices interface with the CPU through buses.
      
            Techniques: Programmed I/O, Interrupt-driven I/O, Direct Memory Access (DMA).
      
            Ensures smooth data flow between peripherals and the processor.
