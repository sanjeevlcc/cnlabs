Concept of Database and Models
------------------------------------
      A database is a structured collection of data that supports
      efficient storage, retrieval, and management.
      
      
      
      
      Database Models define how data is organized:
      ---------------------------------------------
                Hierarchical Model: 
                    Data is organized in a tree structure.
                    Example Scenario: File directories in an operating system.
                
                
                Network Model:
                    Data is represented as a graph, with multiple 
                    parent-child relationships.
                    Example Scenario: Airline routes showing multiple connections.


                Relational Model:
                    Data is stored in tables with rows and 
                    columns.
                    Example Scenario: A library database with "Books" and
                    "Borrowers" tables.
                
      
      
      






Relational Database, Relational Algebra, and Normalization
----------------------------------------------------------
          Relational Database stores data in tables with 
          relationships between them. 
          
          Example: A "Customers" table (CustomerID, Name) linked 
          to "Orders" (OrderID, CustomerID).
          
          Relational Algebra operations:
          
                Selection (σ): Filters rows; e.g., Grade > 90.
                Projection (π): Select specific columns; e.g., Name.
                Join (⨝): Combine tables on a common key.
          
          
          
          Normalization minimizes redundancy:
          
                1NF: Atomic columns; no duplicate rows.
                2NF: Remove partial dependencies.
                3NF: Eliminate transitive dependencies.
                
          
          
          Case Scenario
          ----------------
          A retail chain tracks sales. Database Model: Relational model 
          with "Products" and "Sales" tables. Using Relational Algebra, 
          queries retrieve products with high sales (σ Sales > 1000).
          Normalization ensures no redundant product information.
          
          
                  Q&A
                  Q1: Why use the relational model?
                  A: It ensures data is organized, structured, and easily queried.
                  
                  Q2: How does normalization help?
                  A: It reduces redundancy, ensuring consistency.
                  
      











Basic SQL
-----------
SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to interact with
relational databases. 

It consists of various commands 
categorized into:
---------------------------------
    Data Definition Language (DDL): Defines the structure of the database.
    
    Data Manipulation Language (DML): Handles data operations like insertion 
                                  and retrieval.
    
    Data Control Language (DCL): Manages access control.






Key Commands with Examples
----------------------------
DDL Commands:
        
        CREATE: Creates a new table.
        
        
              CREATE TABLE Students (
                  ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
                  Name VARCHAR(50),
                  Grade FLOAT
              );
        
        
        
        ALTER: Modifies a table.
        
        
              ALTER TABLE Students ADD Age INT;
        
        
        
        
        DROP: Deletes a table.
        
              DROP TABLE Students;



DML Commands:
    
    INSERT: Adds data to a table.
    
            INSERT INTO Students (ID, Name, Grade) VALUES (1, 'Alice', 85.5);
    
    
    
    
    
    SELECT: Retrieves data.
    
    
                SELECT Name, Grade FROM Students WHERE Grade > 80;
    
    
    
    
    
    
    UPDATE: Modifies existing data.
    
    
            UPDATE Students SET Grade = 90 WHERE ID = 1;
    
    
    
    
    
    DELETE: Removes data.
    
    
            DELETE FROM Students WHERE ID = 1;
    




Example Scenario
A library database has a "Books" table 
(BookID, Title, Author, Copies). The librarian uses:

      INSERT to add new books,
      SELECT to find all books by a specific author,
      UPDATE to adjust the number of copies, and
      DELETE to remove outdated records.




Q&A
    Q1: What does the SELECT statement do?
    A: It retrieves specific data from a table based on conditions.
    
    Q2: How is ALTER different from UPDATE?
    A: ALTER changes the table structure, while UPDATE modifies data within the table.


















Concept of Distributed Database
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


      A Distributed Database (DDB) is a collection of interrelated data spread
      across multiple physical locations, managed as a single logical system. 
      These databases improve availability, performance, and fault tolerance.
      Data distribution can be fragmented (split into subsets), replicated 
      (duplicated across sites), or a combination of both.
      
      
      
      Features of Distributed Databases
      ---------------------------------
            Data Distribution: 
                Data resides in different locations, improving performance
                and fault tolerance.
            
            Transparency: 
                  Users interact as if the data is stored centrally.
            
                      Location Transparency: Users need not know where the data
                                              is stored.
                      Replication Transparency: Users don’t manage replicated copies.
            
            Fault Tolerance: 
              Partial failures (e.g., one site down) do not disrupt the entire system.
      
      
            Scalability:
                Additional nodes can be easily added to the system.
            
      
      
      
      
      
      
      Example Scenario
      ------------------------
      A multinational company maintains a distributed
      database for its operations:
      
          Data about US customers is stored in a US server.
          
          European customer data resides in a server in Europe.
          If a query about global sales is issued, the system aggregates
          data from all locations transparently.
      
      
      
      
      Case Scenario
      -------------
      E-commerce Platform: A distributed database stores:
            
                User data in regional servers for fast access.
                Product inventory replicated globally for reliability.
            
            
            If a server in Asia fails, data from other servers ensures
            uninterrupted access. Queries like "Top-selling products globally" 
            integrate data seamlessly.
            
            
            
            Q&A
                Q1: What is the benefit of replication in distributed databases?
                A: It ensures high availability and fault tolerance by maintaining 
                copies of data across locations.
                
                Q2: How does a distributed database handle partial failures?
                A: It uses fault-tolerance mechanisms to continue operating, relying 
                on operational sites.
          

















File and Index
++++++++++++++++++      

In a database, data is stored in files, and indexing is a technique
used to speed up query processing. Both concepts play a crucial 
role in improving data retrieval performance.




File Organization
---------------------
Data can be stored in different file organizations, depending
on the access method and application needs:
    
    Heap Files:
        Data is stored in an unordered manner.
        Use Case: Quick insertions but slow retrieval.
        Example: A table that allows inserting new records without any specific order.
    
    
    Sequential Files:
        Data is stored in a sorted manner based on a key.
        Use Case: Efficient for range queries but slow for insertions and deletions.
        Example: A log of transactions sorted by date.
    
    
    
    Indexed Files:
        Data is stored with an index for fast access.
        Use Case: Efficient for both retrieval and insertion.
        Example: A product catalog with a primary index on product ID.
    




Indexing
--------------
Indexing is a technique that improves query performance by creating
a data structure (like a B-tree) that helps quickly locate records.

          Primary Index:
              Created on the primary key.
              Example: An index on EmployeeID in an employee table.
          
          
          Secondary Index:
              Created on non-primary keys for faster lookups.
              Example: An index on DepartmentName in an employee table for quick search.
          
          Clustered Index:
              Organizes the data file itself according to the indexed columns.
              Example: Data sorted by EmployeeID.
          
          
          
          Non-Clustered Index:
              A separate index structure that points to data locations.
              Example: Indexes on Salary for faster search without changing data order.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    Example Scenario
          Consider a library database with a Books table:
          
          File: Books are stored in a heap file.
          Index: A non-clustered index is created on ISBN for fast 
              lookup when searching by book number.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    Q&A
              Q1: What is the main advantage of indexing?
              A: Indexing speeds up data retrieval by providing quick access paths to
                 the data.
              
              Q2: How do sequential files differ from heap files?
              A: Sequential files store data in sorted order, making them efficient
                 for range queries, while heap files store data in an unordered fashion.
