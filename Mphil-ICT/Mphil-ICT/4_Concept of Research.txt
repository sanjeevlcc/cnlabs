Concept of Research (Research Methodology)
================================================
          
          Foundation of Research and Problem Identification & Formulation
          ---------------------------------------------------------------
                Understanding the purpose of research and its role
                in advancing knowledge.
                
                Identifying and formulating a research problem: the 
                starting point for any study.
                
                Defining the research question, objectives, and hypothesis.
                
          
          
          Research Design/Architecture
          -----------------------------
                The blueprint for conducting research.
                
                Types of research designs: descriptive, 
                exploratory, experimental, etc.
                
                Key elements: sampling methods, data 
                collection methods, tools, and analysis techniques.
          
          
          
          
          Qualitative and Quantitative Research
          --------------------------------------------------------------------
                Qualitative Research:
                    Focuses on understanding phenomena, behaviors, and social 
                    contexts. Methods include interviews, focus groups, and case studies.
                
                Quantitative Research:
                    Focuses on numerical data and statistical analysis. Methods
                    include surveys, experiments, and observations.
              
          
          
          Data Analysis and Interpretation of Data
          --------------------------------------------------------------------
                  Analyzing data using appropriate statistical 
                  or qualitative methods.
                  
                  Interpreting results to draw meaningful conclusions
                  and make informed decisions.
                  
                  Data validation and ensuring reliability and validity.
                  
          
          
          Proposal Writing
          --------------------------------------------------------------------
                Crafting a detailed research proposal that outlines 
                objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes.
                
                A proposal includes the problem statement, literature 
                review, research design, timeline, and budget considerations.
          
          
          
          
          Research Tools
          --------------------------------------------------------------------
                Tools for data collection (e.g., surveys, questionnaires, software for analysis).
                
                Statistical tools like SPSS, R, or Python for quantitative data.
                
                Qualitative analysis software like NVivo for coding and analyzing non-numerical data.
