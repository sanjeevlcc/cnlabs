Background:

The government of a developing country, "Greenlandia," has recently 
launched an ambitious e-governance initiative called "Digital Greenlandia"
to improve public service delivery, reduce corruption, and enhance
citizen engagement. The program includes online portals for tax
filing, business registration, healthcare services, and grievance
redressal. However, six months into the implementation, several
challenges have emerged. Citizens in rural areas are struggling
to access these services due to poor internet connectivity and a
lack of digital literacy. Additionally, there have been reports 
of data breaches, raising concerns about the security of personal
information.



Critical Incident:

A farmer from a remote village, Mr. Raj, tried to apply for 
an agricultural subsidy through the new e-governance portal.
Due to slow internet speeds, the portal crashed multiple times, 
and he was unable to complete the application. Frustrated, he 
traveled to the nearest government office, only to find that 
the staff were untrained to assist him with the online process.
Meanwhile, a data breach exposed the personal information of
thousands of citizens who had registered on the portal, leading 
to public outrage.
