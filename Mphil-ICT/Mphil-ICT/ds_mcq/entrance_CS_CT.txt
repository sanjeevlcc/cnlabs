Okay, the user is preparing for their MPhil entrance exam in ICT, and they need some 
critical reasoning or case study questions. The questions should be worth 25 marks each, totaling 50. 
They want topics related to recent trends in ICT globally and specifically in Nepal.



First, I need to think about the latest ICT trends. Things like 5G, AI, IoT, blockchain,
cloud computing, and digital transformation come to mind. But also, in developing countries
like Nepal, there might be different challenges and applications. Maybe digital divide, 
rural connectivity, e-governance, or ICT in education.


For global trends, 5G deployment is big. But in Nepal, maybe they're still expanding 4G or
dealing with infrastructure issues. AI ethics is another global topic, but how does that
apply in Nepal? Maybe data privacy, or lack of regulations.


Case studies need real-world scenarios. Maybe a telecom company in Nepal rolling out 5G,
but facing challenges like terrain, investment, or policy. Or a government implementing a
digital ID system but facing issues with digital literacy or cybersecurity.


Also, critical reasoning questions could compare global tech with local applicability. 
For example, is investing in 5G the best use of resources for Nepal, or should they focus 
on improving existing 4G and fiber optics?


Another angle: ICT in healthcare, especially post-pandemic. Telemedicine in rural Nepal, 
challenges with internet access, power supply, training healthcare workers.


Cybersecurity is a global issue, but Nepal might lack infrastructure or awareness. A case 
study on a recent cyber attack and the response.


Renewable energy and ICT? Maybe integrating solar power with ICT infrastructure in remote areas.


Education technology: During COVID, online learning was a challenge in Nepal due to connectivity.
How to address that moving forward.


E-governance projects in Nepal, successes and failures. Maybe the implementation of digital services
and citizen adoption rates.


I should structure each question to have a scenario, specific challenges, and ask the candidate to
analyze, evaluate solutions, consider socio-economic factors, and propose strategies.


Need to make sure the questions are balanced between global trends and Nepal-specific contexts.
Also, encourage critical thinking by not having obvious answers but requiring analysis of pros and cons.


Check if the user wants references to real cases. For example, Nepal's National ID system, the 
recent 5G tests by telecom companies, or the Nepal Telecom's expansion projects.



Possible questions:
-----------------------

      1. Case study on deploying 5G in Nepal: technical and policy challenges compared to global trends.
      
      2. AI in agriculture: feasibility in Nepal's context, considering small landholdings and lack of infrastructure.
      
      3. Digital divide in education: post-pandemic, solutions for rural areas.
      
      4. Cybersecurity threats to Nepal's financial sector: case study on a recent breach and mitigation strategies.
      
      5. Blockchain for land registration: pros and cons in reducing corruption and improving transparency.


Each question should ask to evaluate, propose solutions, discuss challenges, and
maybe ethical considerations.





Also, ensure that the questions require application of ICT concepts, not just
theoretical knowledge. Maybe integrating multiple technologies or assessing 
project feasibility.



Need to make sure the questions are clear, have enough detail for a 25-mark answer,
and allow for in-depth analysis. The user might need marking schemes, but they didn't
ask for that. Just the questions.



Check for relevance to Nepal: maybe include examples like Nepal's National Broadband
Policy, Digital Nepal Framework, or specific projects like the e-Governance Master Plan.


Another angle: ICT and environmental sustainability. E-waste management in Nepal, which is 
a growing issue with tech adoption.


Or, use of IoT in disaster management, considering Nepal's vulnerability to earthquakes and floods.


Social media's role in misinformation, especially in a country with increasing internet penetration
but low digital literacy.


Make sure the questions are open-ended enough to allow candidates to demonstrate critical thinking,
rather than just recalling facts.



Possible structure for each question: a brief case scenario, followed by 3-5 sub-question
s that guide the analysis. For example:


"Case Study: The Nepalese government plans to implement a nationwide IoT-based agricultural monitoring
system to improve crop yields. Discuss the potential benefits, challenges related to infrastructure,
data privacy concerns, and strategies for successful implementation considering Nepal's geographical 
and socio-economic context."



That would cover multiple aspects: benefits (ICT in agriculture), challenges (infrastructure like internet 
in rural areas, electricity), data privacy (farmers' data), and strategies (public-private partnerships, 
pilot projects, etc.).

Yes, that seems comprehensive. Each sub-question can be worth a portion of the 25 marks,
ensuring depth.

Need to create two such questions, each with sub-parts, totaling 50 marks. Make sure they're
distinct, covering different areas of ICT, and relevant to both global trends and Nepal's 
scenario.
