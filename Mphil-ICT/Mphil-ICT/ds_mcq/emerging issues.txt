Okay, so I need to figure out the top emerging issues in computer 
science both globally and specifically in Nepal. Then, for each of
these issues, I have to generate scenarios, challenges, analyze and
evaluate solutions, consider factors, and discuss purpose strategies. 
Let me start by brainstorming the possible emerging issues in 
computer science worldwide.

First, AI and Machine Learning are definitely big. They're advancing
rapidly, but there are ethical concerns, bias in algorithms, and job
displacement. Then Quantum Computing is another hot topic; it's still
emerging but has potential to revolutionize fields like cryptography.
Cybersecurity is always a concern as technology evolves, especially
with more IoT devices. Data Privacy is related, especially with 
regulations like GDPR. Edge Computing is growing because of the need
for faster processing closer to data sources. Blockchain beyond 
cryptocurrencies, maybe in supply chains or voting systems. AR/VR 
advancements and their applications. Sustainability in tech, like green 
computing to reduce carbon footprints. Autonomous systems like self-driving cars.
Then there's the digital divide, which is about access to technology.

Now, considering Nepal specifically. They might have different challenges.
Internet penetration is lower, so digital divide is more pronounced. Maybe
less infrastructure for things like quantum computing, but cybersecurity 
could be a big issue as they digitize more services. Also, brain drain 
in tech talent. Maybe issues with implementing AI in agriculture or 
healthcare but lacking resources. Education in computer science might be
lagging. Regulatory challenges for new tech.

Next, I need to create scenarios for each of these issues. For example,
in AI ethics, a scenario where an AI hiring tool discriminates against
certain groups. Challenges would include detecting bias, ensuring fairness.
Solutions might involve diverse training data, audits. Factors are data
quality, regulatory compliance. Purpose strategies could be developing 
ethical guidelines and collaboration with ethicists.

For Nepal, maybe a scenario where a new digital government service is
hacked due to poor cybersecurity. Challenges include lack of expertise, 
funding. Solutions could be training programs, partnerships with international 
bodies. Factors: budget, awareness. Strategies: national cybersecurity 
policy, investing in education.

Wait, I need to make sure I cover both global and Nepal-specific issues. Maybe
list the top 5 global and top 5 Nepal-specific, then go through each with
scenarios, challenges, etc.

Let me structure this step by step. First, list global emerging issues, then
Nepal-specific. Then for each, scenario, challenge, analysis, solutions,
factors, strategies.

Wait, the user asked for top emerging issues in computer science globally
and in the context of Nepal, then generate scenarios, challenges, analyze,
evaluate solutions, factors, purpose strategies. So maybe group them into 
global and Nepal sections.


Possible global issues:

      1. AI Ethics and Bias
      
      2. Quantum Computing
      
      3. Cybersecurity Threats
      
      4. Data Privacy
      
      5. Sustainability in Computing



Nepal-specific issues:

      1. Digital Divide and Access
      
      2. Cybersecurity Infrastructure
      
      3. Tech Education and Brain Drain
      
      4. AI Adoption in Traditional Sectors
      
      5. Regulatory Frameworks for Emerging Tech


For each of these, create a scenario, challenge, analysis, 
solutions, factors, strategies.

But maybe the user wants each issue to have scenario, 
challenge, etc., so perhaps 10 issues in total, 5 global and 5 Nepal.
Alternatively, some issues may overlap but with different contexts.
Let me think of how to present this without redundancy.

Alternatively, maybe present each issue with both global and
Nepal contexts. For example, take AI Ethics: global scenario and
challenges, then how it applies in Nepal with their specific 
scenario and challenges.

But the user might prefer separate sections for global and Nepal. Let
me check the original query: "find top emerging issues of world in computer 
science, as well as in context to nepal and generate some scenario,
challenge, analyze, evaluate solutions, factors, purpose strategies".



So, the structure would be:

        1. Global Emerging Issues in Computer Science
        
        a. Issue 1
        
                - Scenario
                
                - Challenge
                
                - Analysis
                
                - Solutions
                
                - Factors
                
                - Purpose Strategies
        
        b. Issue 2... etc.
        
        
        
        
        2. Emerging Issues in Nepal
        
        a. Issue 1
        
                - Scenario
                
                - Challenge
                
                - Analysis
                
                - Solutions
                
                - Factors
                
                - Purpose Strategies
        
        b. Issue 2... etc.
        




That seems logical. Now, I need to pick 3-5 issues for 
each section. Let's say 5 each.

Global Issues:

            1. AI Ethics and Bias
            
            2. Quantum Computing and Cryptography
            
            3. Cybersecurity and IoT Vulnerabilities
            
            4. Sustainable Green Computing
            
            5. Data Privacy and Regulation



Nepal Issues:
            
            1. Digital Divide and Rural Access
            
            2. Cybersecurity Infrastructure Gaps
            
            3. Brain Drain in Tech Talent
            
            4. AI Adoption in Agriculture/Healthcare

          Strategies: Incentivize green tech, adopt sustainability 
          metrics, global agreements.
          




Data Privacy.

        Scenario: A social media platform faces backlash after 
        selling user data without consent.
        
        Challenge: Balancing data utility with privacy rights.
        
        Analysis: Data monetization vs. user privacy. GDPR-like
        regulations may conflict with business models.

          Analysis: Low wages, few job opportunities, lack of research facilities.
          
          Solutions: Incentivize startups, improve education, diaspora engagement.
          
          Factors: Economic stability, industry growth, academic quality.
          
          Strategies: Tech hubs, tax incentives, remote work opportunities.




AI in Agriculture.

            Scenario: Farmers struggle with crop diseases; AI solutions could help but aren't adopted.
            
            Challenge: Implementing AI in sectors with low tech penetration.
            
            Analysis: Lack of infrastructure, data, and technical know-how.
            
            Solutions: Mobile-based AI tools, partnerships with NGOs, training programs.
            
            Factors: Digital literacy, data collection, funding.
            
            Strategies: Pilot projects, government support, localized solutions.





Tech Regulation.

        Scenario: Cryptocurrency use grows without regulations, leading to fraud cases.
        
        Challenge: Creating policies for emerging technologies without stifling innovation.
        
        Analysis: Rapid tech growth outpaces legislation. Need balanced approach.
        
        Solutions: Regulatory sandboxes, stakeholder consultations, adaptive laws.
        
        Factors: Political climate, international trends, public safety.
        
        Strategies: Tech task forces, update laws regularly, public awareness.






I think this covers the main points. Now, I need to structure
this properly, ensuring each section is clear with the required 
subsections. Also, check for overlap and redundancy. Maybe some 
issues in Nepal are similar to global but with local context.
Make sure explanations are concise and address all 
parts: scenario, challenge, analysis, solutions, factors, strategies.
